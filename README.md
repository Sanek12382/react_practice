Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
You may encounter problems on the main page if the weather api key has expired,
thought this does not hinder the rest of this app in any way.


Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
json-server --watch db.json --port 5000

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


`json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`

start json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
